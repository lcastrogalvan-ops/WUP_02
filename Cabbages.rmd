# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->
 The cabbages data from the MASS package is loaded into a dataframe called veggy. Complete this report by answering the following two questions  
 
### Is there a difference in average VitC between c39 and c52 cultivation methods?  

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

After reviewing all the files and choosing which one to use, I decided on the numerical categorical data.
VitC is a numerical variable, and we will explain it using Cult, which is a factor variable.
A factor variable is a categorical variable. Thatâ€™s how we knew which helper file to upload.  

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
plot(VitC~Cult,data=veggy)
```

This measures how the amount of vitamin C depends on cultivation.
The C52 box is higher than the top of the C39 box, which shows that C52 is much more different from C39.  

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
favstats(VitC~Cult,data=veggy)
```

The Q3 for c39 has a value of 54.75 which is lower than the Q1 for c52 which is 58. Normally a result where the Q3 is higher than a Q1 means that they are significantly different. The probability of getting the other number is a very small number.  

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->


# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
